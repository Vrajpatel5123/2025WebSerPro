My Computer Science expirences are Computer Science 1 basics of Java, Computer Science 2 level 2 of Java and Computer Science 3 full on data structures. 
  Now currently taking Assembly C, Web Server Programming, Web & Database Programming and Discrete and Algorithms. The interesting course I am taking is
  Assembly, Server Programming and Web & Database Programming. I always like to see the behind the scenes of Front end programming on every day usage 
  websites. For example, Amazon, Google, Netflix, Walmart and many more. I always wonder how they update it and keep it running from the increasing amount
  of users per day. 

The things I am expected to gain from taking Web Server Programming is the ability to handle time management, pressure, multi-programming learning capability
  and updating every week as I progress in learning new programming language and making a timeline to complete tasks given every week with other classes
  workload. I am expecting to handle multiple task given to me from this class and other classes to help me become a better planner, programmer and learning
  new features every day.
